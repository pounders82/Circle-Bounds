## General info
This project is a simple application that I created in order to practice the concepts of JavaFx. When the user left clicks on the screen a circle appears which is bounded by a rectangle.  As the user continues to left click more circles appear and they are all bounded by the same rectangle.  When the user right clicks on a circle it disappears and the rectangle is updated to bound the remaining circles.
